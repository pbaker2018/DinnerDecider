# Dinner Decider Android App

This is a simple one-page Android App that takes an array of meal suggestions and will randomly select one for you when you click on the 'decide' button. It has the additional function of allowing the user to 'add' more meal suggestions to the array. 

The App uses Kotlin and this is my first time using Kotlin. It was built using Android Studio.
